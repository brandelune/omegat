  <warning><para>OmegaT is a robust and trustworthy application, but even so, it is smart take precautions to guard against data loss when using it, just as with any other application.</para></warning>

  <para>When you translate the documents in a project, OmegaT stores all your progress in the <link linkend="project.folder.project.save.tmx"
  endterm="project.folder.project.save.tmx.title"/>,
  file located in the project’s <link linkend="project.folder.omegat"
  endterm="project.folder.omegat.title"/> folder. That file is in fact a translation memory and is automatically saved at regular intervals. You can also use <link linkend="menus.project.save" endterm="menus.project.save.title"/> discretionally to make sure that your valuable work is saved.</para>

  <para>Beside of that, OmegaT also backs-up that file, by automatically creating a sequential number of copies (up to ten), marked with a timestamp, every time you open or reload your project.</para>

<para>These backup filenames’ follow the pattern <filename>project_save.tmx.YYYYMMDDhhmm.bak</filename> where the final part is the time stamp indicating when the file was created: <code>YYYY</code>
  represents the 4-digit year, <code>MM</code> the month, <code>DD</code> the day of the month, and <code>hh</code>
  and <code>mm</code> indicate the hours and minutes.</para>

  <para>The file <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> always contains the most recent data, which is a copy of <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> created when the project was opened. Then come the incremental backup files that are created as your translation progresses. <filename>project_save.tmx</filename> is always the file with the most recent data.</para>

  <para>If you believe that you have lost translation data, follow the steps
  below to restore the project to the most recent backup memory, which is
  usually less than ten minutes old or so.</para>

  <para>To avoid losing important data:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>Make regular copies of the file
      <filename>/omegat/project_save.tmx</filename> to a backup media, such as a
      USB key or an external hard drive, or to a cloud service.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>While you are still familiarizing yourself with OmegaT, create
      translated files at regular intervals to make sure they contain the latest
      version of your translation.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Be very cautious about making changes to the files in the source
      folder, to the segmentation rules, or to the file filters, partway through
      a project. Modifying either after you have started your translation could
      result in OmegaT becoming unable to find a segment that you have already
      translated.</para>
